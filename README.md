#Garden Growing Game ðŸŒ³
Welcome to the Garden Growing Game, a console-based C++ game where you manage your own virtual garden with some interesting rules to have fun!
#Game Rules
- Grid-Based Garden: The game is played on a grid, starting with a 3x3 size.
- Choosing Your Crop: You can choose between two different fruits to plant on the grid garden:
- Tomato or Pineapple
- Planting Seeds: You can only plant seeds in two consecutive locations (blocks) at a time. This means you must plant them side-by-side, either horizontally or vertically.
- Limited Space: If you run out of valid consecutive spaces, you can no longer plant new seeds. At this point, you have a couple of choices:

	- Harvest and Sell: You can sell your fruits to clear some space in the garden. This lets you start planting again. Your      harvested produce items are then shown packed in a box, ready to be sold.

 	- Expand Your Garden: You can buy a larger garden, increasing your grid size to a maximum of 6x6. This provides more room to plant and grow!
